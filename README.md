## Session 1 - Getting Started with Rails

The first session is all about getting started with Rails.

We talk about MVC Architecture and different components that make a

In the assignment, we will learn how to install Ruby and Rails, create a
new Rails project and build a simple "About Me" webiste with two pages.
